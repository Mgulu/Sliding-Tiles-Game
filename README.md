# Sliding tiles
Sliding tiles allows are used to input an initial grid as well 
as the goal grid. 
# Requirements
python environment 
# Dependencies 
None, code only uses python standard library 
# How to use
The user will be prompted to input a single number 9 times until 
the initial grid has been made.
The user will be prompted to input a single number 9 times until the
goal grid has been made.
It will then prompt the user to choose either manhattan or misplaced tiles as the heuristic to be used. 
After that the program runs until a solution has been found (can be stuck in an infinite loop)
Once the program finishes it will return all the moves it took
