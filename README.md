The game asks for the number of rows , followed by asking the user to input a single number 9 times until the initial grid has been made, this is repeated for goal grid.
It will then prompt the user to choose either manhattan or misplaced tiles as the heuristic to be used. 
After that the program runs until a solution has been found (can be stuck in an infinite loop)
Once the program finishes it will return all the moves it took
